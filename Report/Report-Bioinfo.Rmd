## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Developing a Linear Regression Model

By examining the impact of drugs on cell growth at various concentrations, we have gained valuable insights into their potential as cancer treatments. Through linear regression analysis we have been able to determine the relationship between concentrations of several drugs and their effects on cell growth. We used the built-in function lm to do the training. This allows us to estimate how different concentrations may effect cell growth and identify the optimal concentration for inhibiting cancer cell growth. By combining this knowledge with information on the mechanisms of action and target sites of these drugs, we can explore potential solutions for cancer treatment. This approach enables us to identify promising drug candidates and optimize their dosage strategies, with the aim of maximizing their efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, offering new possiblities in the field of cancer therapy.

#Adapting the data sets

In order to successfully analyze the data sets, the matching order of the cell identificators and the gene names was ensured. In effect, five new data frames were created: new_prism.treat, new_prism.exp, new_prism.cl, new_prism.cnv and new_prism.achilles. These new data frames all adopt the same ordering of the cell lines as depicted in the original prism data frame. Additionally, the data frames providing information on genes such as prism.exp, prism.cnv and prism.achilles have all been modified to arrange the gene columns in aphabetical order. Using these new data frames, several options were facilitated, such as conserving the indices of desired elements across data frames, analyzing differences between the data frames locally and testing whether operations on the data frames bring the desired result by providing the same index input.


#Description of the data set

The prism table provides the sensitivity values of the cell lines to different drugs. The data frames "molecule_indeces_data_frame" and "moa_indeces_data_frame" contain all active molecules present in drugs and their respective mechanisms of action and the column positions of the drugs they are found in in the prism data frame. Below you can see a sample of these data frames

*Table 1.1 and Table 1.2: active molecules and mechanisms of action in drugs, introduce head of the 2 molecule and moa data frames*

The eight different positions of the same molecule or mechanism of action refer to the eight different concentrations in which a drug is present at. If sixteen positions are being shown, it means that the molecule or mechanism of action is present in two different drug types.

From all the 481 cell lines present in the prism data frame, the 17 cell lines involved in liver cancer are identified below:

Mutagenesis is a driving factor of cancer development and progression. Below are the numbers of mutations identified in each of the liver cancer cell lines

#Developing a Linear Regression Model

To move on with the linear regression, we determined an optimal threshold for the R^2 value which served as a criterion for assessing the reliability of linear regression analyses. Drugs that exhibited an R^2 value above this threshold were considered reliable in terms of their efficacy. For each distinct liver cancer cell line, we filtered the drugs that met the reliablitiy criterion, resulting in a subset of drugs with reliable regression models. We then examined the frequency of occurence for these reliable drugs across the different liver cancer cell lines. By identifying the most frquently occuring drug, we obtained the linear regression results with the highest consistency and reliability. In our case, for the liver cancer cell lines, our analyses resulted that the drug "BRD_K70358946_001_15_7" occur 8 times in 17 cancer cell lines which is almost the half of them.






###Discussion:
Plotting the linear regression results for this drug allowed us to visualize its impact on cell growth in liver cancer. This integrated approach, combining regression analysis, filtering based on reliability, and examining drug frequencies, provides insights into the drugs that exhibit strong regression relationships and their potential for effective treatment in liver cancer. By predicting the most efficient concentrations for a stronger inhibition, we can have different therapy possibilities for cancer.
