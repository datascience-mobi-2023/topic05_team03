## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

  DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES LIVER CANCER
### SYNTHESIS SO FAR:
  0.
  Please run these before running the others
  If new_prism.exp or new_prism.cl don't work, you can just use the normal prism.exp or prism.cl
```{r}
copy_prism.cl = prism.cl
order_actual_cl = rownames (copy_prism.cl)
order_target_cl = rownames(prism)
new_prism.cl= copy_prism.cl[match(order_target_cl, order_actual_cl),]
new_prism.cl

copy_prism.exp = prism.exp
order_actual_exp = rownames (copy_prism.exp)
order_target_exp = rownames(prism)
new_prism.exp= copy_prism.exp[match(order_target_exp, order_actual_exp),]
new_prism.exp

liver_cancer_cl_indices = which(new_prism.cl$disease == "Liver Cancer")
length(liver_cancer_cl_indices)
liver_cancer_cell_lines = rownames(new_prism.cl[liver_cancer_cl_indices,])
```
  
  1. 
```{r}

# Filter the "new_prism.exp" data frame to include only liver cancer cell lines
liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression = new_prism.exp[liver_cancer_cell_lines, ]

#These are all the other cell lines that aren't associated with liver cancer and their expression scores
not_liver_cancer_cell_lines = rownames(new_prism.cl[new_prism.cl$disease != "Liver Cancer",])
not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression = new_prism.exp[not_liver_cancer_cell_lines, ]


#We will use a t-test to compare the expression levels of the genes in liver cancer cell lines and those in cancer cell lines that are not associated to liver cancer:
for (col in colnames(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression)) {
  result = t.test(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[col]], not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[col]])
  liver_cancer_differential_genes[[col]] = result
}
liver_cancer_differential_genes
#length(names(liver_cancer_differential_genes))
#We have a t-test for every gene
```


2. 
```{r}
#Now, we would like to check which ones of these genes are actually significant, so really differently expressed in liver cancer than in other cancer types. So, we will set a threshold and choose those genes, where the t-test had a small p-value (under the significance level)

#First, we will adjust the p-values of the multiple t-testing:
p_values_liver_vs_noliver = sapply(liver_cancer_differential_genes, function(t_test_liver_noliver) t_test_liver_noliver$p.value)
adjusted_p.values = p.adjust(p_values_liver_vs_noliver, method = "BH")

#Now, we can set the significance level at 1%:
significant_genes_liver_cancer = colnames(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression)[adjusted_p.values < 0.01]
significant_genes_liver_cancer
```

3. CHECK IF THE DATA IS NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED!!!

```{r}
#I want to check the normality of the data with different methods
#First, I will perform a Shapiro-Wilk Test:
#shapiro.test(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression)
#shapiro.test(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression)

#First for the liver cancer cell lines...
storage_for_result1=list()

for (gene in colnames(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression)) 
 { 
  if(all(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene]] == liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene]][1]))
    next
#Here, I had a problem because one column had only zeros, so all the elements were the same. SO if everything is the same, we just skip this iteration
  else
    storage_for_result1[[gene]] = shapiro.test(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene]])
 
  
}
liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality = storage_for_result1

#Now for the not liver cancer cell lines:
#I first tried this code:

#storage_for_result2 = list()

#for (gene2 in colnames(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression)) {
#  if (all(!is.na(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene2]])) &&
#      all(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene2]] == #not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene2]][1])) {
#    next
#  } else {
#    if (all(!is.na(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene2]]))) {
#      storage_for_result2[[gene2]] = shapiro.test(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression[[gene2]])
#    }
#  }
#}
#storage_for_result2

#But the problem was, that my storage_for_result2 was empty (NULL)


# Ok, so maybe there is too much missing data, let's create a function to replace the NA values with the mean
replace_na = function(x) {
  na_mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)  
  x[is.na(x)] = na_mean 
  return(x)
}
not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona = apply(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression, 2, replace_na)
not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona = as.data.frame(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona)
#Here the problem was that the data type changed and for the analysis to work we needed the same data type


# Now let's check with the shapiro test

storage_for_result2=list()

for (gene2 in colnames(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona)) 
 { 
  if(all(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona[[gene2]] == not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona[[gene2]][1]))
    next
  else
    storage_for_result2[[gene2]] = shapiro.test(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_wona[[gene2]])
 
  
}
not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality = storage_for_result2

#liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality and not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality contain the shapiro tests that check whether or not these genes are normally distributed
```

```{r}
liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality
```

```{r}
not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality
```

```{r}
#length(names(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality))
#length(names(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality))
```

```{r}
#Checking for significance

p_values_normal_liver = sapply(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality, function(result){
  result$p.value
})

significant_genes_normality_liver = names(liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality)[which(p_values_normal_liver > 0.70)]

#significant_genes_normality_liver

```

```{r}
#now let's do the same for the ones form not liver cancer
p_values_normal_not_liver = sapply(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality, function(result){
  result$p.value
})

significant_genes_normality_not_liver = names(not_liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression_normality)[which(p_values_normal_not_liver > 0.70)]

#significant_genes_normality_not_liver
```

```{r}

#ok, so these are the genes that are normally expressed, so for these genes we will consider the t-tests
normality_genes = significant_genes_normality_liver[which(significant_genes_normality_liver %in% significant_genes_normality_not_liver)]
normality_genes

```

```{r}
normality_genes[which(normality_genes %in% significant_genes_liver_cancer)]
```
The problem is:
I have tried several significance levels from 0.99 to 0.8. I always get the response that there are no genes that are differentially expressed in liver cancer AND normaly distributed. The threshold of 0.7 seems pretty low to me. I am afraid I am doing something wrong. What would you advise?
