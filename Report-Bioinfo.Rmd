## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Methods:
Developing a Linear Regression Model

By examining the impact of drugs on cell growth at various concentrations, we have gained valuable insights into their potential as cancer treatments. Through linear regression analysis we have been able to determine the relationship between concentrations of several drugs and their effects on cell growth. We used the built-in function lm to do the training. This allows us to estimate how different concentrations may effect cell growth and identify the optimal concentration for inhibiting cancer cell growth. By combining this knowledge with information on the mechanisms of action and target sites of these drugs, we can explore potential solutions for cancer treatment. This approach enables us to identify promising drug candidates and optimize their dosage strategies, with the aim of maximizing their efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, offering new possiblities in the field of cancer therapy.



Results:
Developing a Linear Regression Model

To move on with the linear regression, we determined an optimal threshold for the R^2 value which served as a criterion for assessing the reliability of linear regression analyses. Drugs that exhibited an R^2 value above this threshold were considered reliable in terms of their efficacy. For each distinct liver cancer cell line, we filtered the drugs that met the reliablitiy criterion, resulting in a subset of drugs with reliable regression models. We then examined the frequency of occurence for these reliable drugs across the different liver cancer cell lines. By identifying the most frquently occuring drug, we obtained the linear regression results with the highest consistency and reliability. In our case, for the liver cancer cell lines, our analyses resulted that the drug "BRD_K70358946_001_15_7" occur 8 times in 17 cancer cell lines which is almost the half of them.




Discussion:
Plotting the linear regression results for this drug allowed us to visualize its impact on cell growth in liver cancer. This integrated approach, combining regression analysis, filtering based on reliability, and examining drug frequencies, provides insights into the drugs that exhibit strong regression relationships and their potential for effective treatment in liver cancer. By predicting the most efficient concentrations for a stronger inhibition, we can have different therapy possibilities for cancer.
