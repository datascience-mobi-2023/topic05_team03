## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#Okay, let's get started into creating that prediction model we talked about...
#Let's integrate all the knowledge we've gathered here:

1.Cell lines with mutations of specific genes do play a role
2.Copy number variation and expression are bound together
3.Expression of target genes of drugs and sensibility to specific drugs?

#Let's separate factors of drug sensitivity according to their contribution to general variation
#PCA, clustering, linear regression

```{r}
#prcomp(t(prism))
#prcom(prism)
#princomp(t(prism))
prcomp(t(prism),na.omit)
#what is the problem here?Ask Ana
```
```{r}
#v=var(prism)
length(v)
sum(is.na(v))
#why is this??
```
Let's try that linear regression!

```{r}
install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")
```


First for expression and copy number variation!
```{r}
lm()
#liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression is for prism.exp
#liver_cancer_cell_lines_scores is for prism
```

```{r}

```


Now for expression and drug efficiency

```{r}
lm(liver_cancer_cell_lines_scores["ACH-000217",]~liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression["ACH-000217",], data=c(liver_cancer_cell_lines_scores, liver_cancer_cell_lines_expression))
#what is wrong here?
```
