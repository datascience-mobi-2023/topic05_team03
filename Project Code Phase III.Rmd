## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#Okay, let's get started into creating that prediction model we talked about...
#Let's integrate all the knowledge we've gathered here:

1.Cell lines with mutations of specific genes do play a role
2.Copy number variation and expression are bound together
3.Expression of target genes of drugs and sensibility to specific drugs?

#Let's separate factors of drug sensitivity according to their contribution to general variation
#PCA, clustering, linear regression
